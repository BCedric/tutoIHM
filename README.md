# Angular 2 Base Project

This is a basic project which can be as a base to new ones.

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular2 development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

## Create a new project based on this

Clone this repo into new project folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/H-Abdel/Angular-2-Base-Project my-first-proj
cd my-first-proj
```

## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

**Attention Windows Developers:  You must run all of these commands in administrator mode**.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to write your application.
